The Odin Project: Recipes

This current project is based of The Odin ProjectL Recipes Foundation Course
 
I will be implementing various skills I've learned so far. Thing such as git commands, html commands and implementation, terminal command to manage directories and files.

As of right now, I made my first webpage that has various implementation of HTML commands like <p> <h1> <ul> <ol> <a href=> <img src=> and memorized the doctype declaration which is vital for web development.
